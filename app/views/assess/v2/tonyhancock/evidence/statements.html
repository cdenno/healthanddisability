      <p>Tony says he can: move safely and repeatedly on level ground without needing to stop for:
        <span class="bold-small">100 metres</span>

      <h3 class="heading-small mt5 mb0">Moving around and using steps</h3>
      <p class="mt0 quote">“I have arthritis in my right knee and hip, and also in both wrists. On a good day I can walk 100m slowly - I'd have to rest a couple of times though, as I'd be in pain. I can't use a stick or crutches or a wheelchair because the arthritis in my wrists means I can't grip and don't have much strength. On a bad day, I can just about get around my flat but would usually stay in bed so I don't have to move much.”</p>
